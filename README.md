# CalorieGuide
My College Project on Android Studio.

This app wil help users to look up their daily calorie intake using a food API. 
Set up a calorie daily goal and see how much calories they still are able to eat to fit in the limit

User's will also be able to keep track of their weight and see the progress of what healthy calorie intake can make on their bodies.

This app is going to include Authorization, Database of User's wheight, food API. Ability to add your own food to the list of available options.
